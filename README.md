# MBG 209 – Term Paper: Genetic Analysis of Parkinson’s Disease

This repository contains a term paper for the **MBG 209 - Molecular Biology and Genetics** course at **Bilkent University**. The paper focuses on the **genetic basis of Parkinson’s Disease (OMIM Entry 168600)** and explores the disease from both a functional genomics and population genetics perspective.

##  Student Info
- **Name**: Berfin Örtülü  

##  Report Overview

The report investigates Parkinson’s Disease by analyzing:

- Key genes associated with the disease: **SNCA, LRRK2, PARK2, GBA1, MAPT**
- Genetic variants including:
  - Synonymous, missense, and pLOF (predicted loss-of-function)
  - Pathogenic vs. benign variants
- Gene function, chromosomal locations, inheritance patterns
- Gene-specific expression analysis across tissues using **GTEx**
- Variant impact predictions using **VEP ENSEMBL**
- Population-specific allele frequencies using **gnomAD**

##  Tools and Databases Used

- **OMIM** – Genetic basis and gene-disease associations  
- **gnomAD** – Variant frequency and tolerance scores  
- **GTEx Portal** – Tissue-specific gene expression and eQTL analysis  
- **VEP ENSEMBL** – Variant Effect Predictor for functional impact  

##  Highlights

- Detailed variant tables for each gene  
- Pathogenic & benign variants with VEP screenshots  
- Tissue-specific expression analysis (e.g., brain, heart, liver, skin)  
- Population distribution of key SNPs

##  Note

This repository contains the final version of the **MBG 209 term paper** (PDF), submitted as part of the coursework in Spring 2025.
